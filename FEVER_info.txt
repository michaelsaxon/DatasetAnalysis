The train/dev/test data are contained in the three jsonl files. 
The query and context field correspond to premise and hypothesis and the 
SUPPORT, REFUTE, and NOT ENOUGH INFO labels correspond to ENTAILMENT, CONTRADICT, 
and NEUTRAL label, respectively, in the typical NLI settings. 

The cid can be mapped back the original FEVER id field. 
(The labels for both dev and test are hidden but you can retrieve the label for dev 
using the cid and the original FEVER data.) Finally, you can train your NLI model 
using this data and get FEVER verification label results. The label accuracy on dev 
and test will be comparable to the previous fact-checking works and you can submit 
your entries to FEVER CodaLab Leaderboard to report test results.
